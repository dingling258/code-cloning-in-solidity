# Code Cloning in Solidity Smart Contracts: Prevalence, Evolution, and Impact on Development

## Introduction

This repository contains all the data details related to our paper: **Code Cloning in Solidity Smart Contracts: Prevalence, Evolution, and Impact on Development**

## Repository Structure

### Data Folder

The `data` folder contains the experimental results obtained from our study. For detailed information about the contents, please refer to the `overview` document within the folder.

### Python Folder

The `python` folder contains the script files used in our experiments. These scripts perform various functions, including:

- Extracting Solidity (.sol) files
- Calculating total lines of code (excluding comments)
- Calculating total lines of cloned code
- Comparing NiCad detection files to obtain three types of co-evolved functions
- And more...

## Environment Setup

To replicate our experiments, you'll need to set up the appropriate environment. We recommend using Docker for environment configuration to ensure consistency and ease of setup.
