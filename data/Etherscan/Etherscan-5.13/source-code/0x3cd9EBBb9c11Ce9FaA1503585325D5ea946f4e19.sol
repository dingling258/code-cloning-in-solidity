The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning.

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
