A call to an ERC20 contract, authorizing this contract to transfer funds on behalf of the user.\n  2. A call to :sol:func:`deposit` indicating the starkKey, amount, asset type and target vault ID to which to send the deposit.\n\n  The amount should be quantized, according to the specific quantization defined for the asset type.\n\n  The result of the operation, assuming all requirements are met, is that an amount of ERC20 tokens\n  equaling the amount specified in the :sol:func:`deposit` call times the quantization factor is\n  transferred on behalf of the user to the contract. In addition, the contract adds the funds to an\n  accumulator of pending deposits for the provided user, asset ID and vault ID.\n\n  Once a deposit is made, the exchange may include it in a proof which will result in addition\n  of the amount(s) deposited to the off-chain vault with the specified ID. When the contract\n  receives such valid proof, it deducts the transfered funds from the pending deposits for the\n  specified Stark key, asset ID and vault ID.\n\n  The exchange will not be able to move the deposited funds to the off-chain vault if the Stark key\n  is not registered in the system.\n\n  Until that point, the user may cancel the deposit by performing a time-locked cancel-deposit\n  operation consisting of two calls:\n\n  1. A call to :sol:func:`depositCancel`, setting a timer to enable reclaiming the deposit. Until this timer expires the user cannot reclaim funds as the exchange may still be processing the deposit for inclusion in the off chain vault.\n  2. A call to :sol:func:`depositReclaim`, to perform the actual transfer of funds from the contract back to the ERC20 contract. This will only succeed if the timer set in the previous call has expired. The result should be the transfer of all funds not accounted for in proofs for off-chain inclusion, back to the user account on the ERC20 contract.\n\n  Calling depositCancel and depositReclaim can only be done via an ethKey that is associated with\n  that vault's starkKey.

For ERC20 tokens, it is 36 bytes long.\n\n  For each token type, the following constant 4-byte hash is defined, called the `selector`:\n\n   | `ETH_SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(\"ETH()\"));`\n   | `ERC20_SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(\"ERC20Token(address)\"));`\n   | `ERC721_SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(\"ERC721Token(address,uint256)\"));`\n   | `MINTABLE_ERC20_SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(\"MintableERC20Token(address)\"));`\n   | `MINTABLE_ERC721_SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(\"MintableERC721Token(address,uint256)\"));`\n\n  For each token type, `assetInfo` is defined as follows:\n\n\n  The `quantum` quantization factor defines the multiplicative transformation from the native token\n  denomination as a 256b unsigned integer to a 63b unsigned integer representation as used by the\n  Stark exchange. Only amounts in the native representation that represent an integer number of\n  quanta are allowed in the system.\n\n  The asset type is restricted to be the result of a hash of the `assetInfo` and the\n  `quantum` masked to 250 bits (to be less than the prime used) according to the following formula:\n\n  | ``uint256 assetType = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(assetInfo, quantum))) &``\n  | ``0x03FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF;``\n\n  Once registered, tokens cannot be removed from the system, as their IDs may be used by off-chain\n  accounts.\n\n  New tokens may only be registered by a Token Administrator.

A call to an offchain exchange API, requesting a withdrawal from a user account (vault).\n  2. A call to the on-chain :sol:func:`withdraw` function to perform the actual withdrawal of funds transferring them to the users Eth or ERC20 account (depending on the token type).\n\n  For simplicity, hereafter it is assumed that all tokens are ERC20 tokens but the text below\n  applies to Eth in the same manner.\n\n  In the first call mentioned above, anyone can call the API to request the withdrawal of an\n  amount from a given vault. Following the request, the exchange may include the withdrawal in a\n  STARK proof. The submission of a proof then results in the addition of the amount(s) withdrawn to\n  an on-chain pending withdrawals account under the stark key of the vault owner and the appropriate\n  asset ID. At the same time, this also implies that this amount is deducted from the off-chain\n  vault.\n\n  Once the amount to be withdrawn has been transfered to the on-chain pending withdrawals account,\n  the user may perform the second call mentioned above to complete the transfer of funds from the\n  Stark Exchange contract to the appropriate ERC20 account. Only a user holding the Eth key\n  corresponding to the Stark Key of a pending withdrawals account may perform this operation.\n\n  It is possible that for multiple withdrawal calls to the API, a single withdrawal call to the\n  contract may retrieve all funds, as long as they are all for the same asset ID.\n\n  The result of the operation, assuming all requirements are met, is that an amount of ERC20 tokens\n  in the pending withdrawal account times the quantization factor is transferred to the ERC20\n  account of the user.\n\n  A withdrawal request cannot be cancelled. Once funds reach the pending withdrawals account\n  on-chain, they cannot be moved back into an off-chain vault before completion of the withdrawal\n  to the ERC20 account of the user.\n\n  In the event that the exchange reaches a frozen state the user may perform a withdrawal operation\n  via an alternative flow, known as the \"Escape\" flow. In this flow, the API call above is replaced\n  with an :sol:func:`escape` call to the on-chain contract (see :sol:mod:`Escapes`) proving the\n  ownership of off-chain funds. If such proof is accepted, the user may proceed as above with\n  the :sol:func:`withdraw` call to the contract to complete the operation.\n*/\nabstract contract Withdrawals is\n    MainStorage,\n
